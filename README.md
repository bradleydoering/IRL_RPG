IRL RPG is a stat tracking app that allows you to train skills like Runescape. 
Go to the gym - get weighlifitng XP
Read for 30 mins every day? Level up your "Reading" skill

The goal of this is to motivate myself to stick to my habits. My word for the year is "Consistency" and I've never had trouble being consistent with playing video games.

I've never made a mobile app before, so I'm just playing around and learning. Maybe eventually you'll be able to share your stats with friends. Maybe I'll introduce avatars. idk. Maybe not.
